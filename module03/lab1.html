<h2>Thoughts from real players</h2>
<h3>Tamashi55</h3>
<p>"Everything is awful. Sure you might have the occasional easy kill BB, but once you get to those Grandmaster pricks it becomes almost impossible."</p>
<h3>JeffreyRinas</h3>
<p>"Mobility. The fact they can get away for free and are annoying as hell to vanquish [kill]. Stop running and fight like a man coward!"</p>
<h3>bladestorm1745</h3>
<p>"Branium feels unfair because all they had to do was charge up for a second or two and ran into you. No fair f****** fight just pump them with a couple</p>
<p>shots and then you die."</p>
